Have you amassed such a vast collection of snippets, that remembering the prefixes to use each one is nigh-impossible?

Do you find yourself with too many things you _want_ as snippets, but not enough time to _create all of them_?

**Enter: snip-lookup.nvim!**

---

Let me preface with saying that I LOVE snippets. Whether I'm using them to
quickly type out my home address, or for commonly-typed code-snippets - I find
myself constantly using or creating them.

That being said, I also have have several "wants" that I (until now) _haven't_ been able to fulfill:

- I want editing my snippets to be fast and easy, so I can tweak them on the fly
- I want to version control my snippets, so I can use them across multiple computers
- I want to categorize my snippets, so I can quickly know what snippets I have
- I want to fuzzy-search through my snippets, so I can select snippets faster

**snip-lookup.nvim solves those by:**

- Storing all your snippets in a simple YAML file of your choosing
  - Specify a file path to easily version control your snippets!
  - For example, you can store your work-specific snippets in a work repository
- Providing a keybind for instantly editing your snippets
- Utilizing [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) to fuzzy-search through existing categories/snippets

## Requirements

- [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- Cargo (For building from source)

## Installation and Setup

Using [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
use {
    'rnprest/snip-lookup.nvim',
        requires = { 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim' },
        run = './build.sh',
        config = function()
            require('snip-lookup').setup {
                -- Default options are listed below - you can just call setup() if these are fine with you
                open_picker = '<leader>sl',
                open_config = '<leader>esl',
                config_file = vim.fn.stdpath 'data' .. '/snip-lookup/snippets.yaml',
            }
    end,
}
```

## Usage

Searching through your snippets

1. Hit `<leader>sl`
2. Start typing the name of your category
   - Hit `<CR>` to select a category
3. Start typing the name of your snippet
   - Hit `<CR>` to copy the selected snippet to your clipboard

Editing your snippets

1. Hit `<leader>esl`
2. Start editing to your heart's content
   - To save your changes, just save the file.
   - Any changes made will be immediately available the next time you hit your search remap
