Have you amassed such a vast collection of snippets, that remembering the prefixes to use each one is nigh-impossible?

Do you find yourself with too many things you _want_ as snippets, but not enough time to _create all of them_?

**Enter: snip-lookup.nvim!**

---

Let me preface with saying that I LOVE snippets. Whether I'm using them to
quickly type out my home address, or for commonly-typed code-snippets - I find
myself constantly using or creating them.

That being said, I also have have several "wants" that I (until now) _haven't_ been able to fulfill:

- I want editing my snippets to be fast and easy, so I can tweak them on the fly
- I want to version control my snippets, so I can use them across multiple computers
- I want to categorize my snippets, so I can quickly know what snippets I have
- I want to fuzzy-search through my snippets, so I can select snippets faster

**snip-lookup.nvim solves those by:**

- Storing all your snippets in a simple YAML file of your choosing
  - Specify a file path to easily version control your snippets!
  - For example, you can store your work-specific snippets in a work repository
- Providing a keybind for instantly editing your snippets
- Utilizing [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) to fuzzy-search through existing categories/snippets

## Requirements

- [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- **[Optional]** cargo and rust toolchain

## Installation and Setup

### Install Latest Release

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
    'rnprest/snip-lookup.nvim',
    dependencies = 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
    build = './install.sh',
    config = function()
        require('snip-lookup').setup {
            -- Default options are listed below - you can just call setup() if these are fine with you
            open_picker = '<leader>sl',
            open_config = '<leader>esl',
            config_file = vim.fn.stdpath 'data' .. '/snip-lookup/snippets.yaml',
        }
    end,
    -- Lazy-load when your chosen key mappings are hit
    keys = {
        '<leader>sl',
        '<leader>esl',
    },
}
```

Using [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
use {
    'rnprest/snip-lookup.nvim',
        requires = 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
        run = './install.sh',
        config = function()
            require('snip-lookup').setup {
                -- Default options are listed below - you can just call setup() if these are fine with you
                open_picker = '<leader>sl',
                open_config = '<leader>esl',
                config_file = vim.fn.stdpath 'data' .. '/snip-lookup/snippets.yaml',
            }
    end,
}
```

### Build From Source

> **NOTE:** requires
> [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to
> be installed. The only difference between this use block and the one used for
> installing the latest release, is the addition of the `build` argument for
> our install script.

            open_picker = '<leader>sl',
            open_config = '<leader>esl',
            config_file = vim.fn.stdpath 'data' .. '/snip-lookup/snippets.yaml',
        }
    end,
    -- Lazy-load when your chosen key mappings are hit
    keys = {
        '<leader>sl',
        '<leader>esl',
    },
}
```

```lua
use {
    'rnprest/snip-lookup.nvim',
        requires = 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
        run = './install.sh build',
        config = function()
            require('snip-lookup').setup {
                -- Default options are listed below - you can just call setup() if these are fine with you
                open_picker = '<leader>sl',
                open_config = '<leader>esl',
                config_file = vim.fn.stdpath 'data' .. '/snip-lookup/snippets.yaml',
            }
    end,
}
```

## Usage

Searching through your snippets

1. Hit `<leader>sl`
2. Start typing the name of your category
   - Hit `<CR>` to select a category
3. Start typing the name of your snippet
   - Hit `<CR>` to copy the selected snippet to your clipboard

Editing your snippets

1. Hit `<leader>esl`
2. Start editing to your heart's content
   - To save your changes, just save the file.
   - Any changes made will be immediately available the next time you hit your search remap

## Documentation

Snippet file structure:

```
categories:
  <snippet category>:
    icon: <icon> # Setting this is OPTIONAL, and will default to blank space
    snippets:
      - <snippet name>: <snippet contents>
      - ...
  ...
```

Example (This will be the default content of your snippet file):

```yaml
categories:
  Email Addresses:
    icon: ðŸ“§
    snippets:
      - John Doe: john.doe@gmail.com
      - Jane Doe: jane.doe@gmail.com
  Phone Numbers:
    icon: ðŸ“ž
    snippets:
      - Jack Black: (111) 111-1111
      - Jill Dill: (222) 222-2222
  File Templates:
    snippets:
      - README: |-
          # Title

          ## Installation

          ## Usage
  Email Groups:
    snippets:
      - Family: >-
          mom@gmail.com;
          dad@hotmail.com;
          brother@aol.com;
          sister@yahoo.com;
          son@proton.me;
          daughter@outlook.com
```

## Known Issues

If you find that your icons and category names don't share the same consistent width when searching through categories, it could be because of the emoji you're trying to use.

I'm not sure how to fix this other than by replacing the problematic emoji (demonstrated below), but if someone thinks they could find a proper solution then that would be greatly appreciated!
